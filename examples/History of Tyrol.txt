HISTORY OF THE FOREST IN CENTRAL EUROPE
 The history of the forest in Central Europe is characterised by thousands of years of exploitation
by people.  Thus a distinction needs to be made between the botanical natural history of the forest
in pre- and proto-historical times--which falls mainly into the fields of natural history and
Paleobotany--and the onset of the period of sedentary settlement which began at the latest in the
Neolithic era in Central Europe - and thus the use of the forest by people, which is covered by the
disciplines of history, archaeology, cultural studies and ecology.

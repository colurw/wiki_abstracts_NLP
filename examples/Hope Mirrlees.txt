LUD-IN-THE-MIST
Lud-in-the-Mist (1926) is the third and final novel by the British writer Hope Mirrlees.  It
continues the author's exploration of the themes of Life and Art, by a method already described in
the preface of her first novel, Madeleine: One of Love's Jansenists (1919): "to turn from time to
time upon the action the fantastic limelight of eternity, with a sudden effect of unreality and the
hint of a world within a world".

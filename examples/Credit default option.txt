CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP INDEX
A credit default swap index is a credit derivative used to hedge credit risk or to take a position
on a basket of credit entities.  Unlike a credit default swap, which is an over the counter credit
derivative, a credit default swap index is a completely standardized credit security and may
therefore be more liquid and trade at a smaller bid-offer spread.

SEDIMENT
Sediment is a naturally occurring material that is broken down by processes of weathering and
erosion, and is subsequently transported by the action of wind, water, or ice or by the force of
gravity acting on the particles.  For example, sand and silt can be carried in suspension in river
water and on reaching the sea bed deposited by sedimentation; if buried, they may eventually become
sandstone and siltstone (sedimentary rocks) through lithification.

SEDIMENTATION
Sedimentation is the deposition of sediments.  It takes place when particles in suspension settle
out of the fluid in which they are entrained and come to rest against a barrier.

LEGACY SEDIMENT
Legacy sediment (LS) is depositional bodies of sediment inherited from the increase of human
activities since the Neolithic.  These include a broad range of land use and land cover changes,
such as agricultural clearance, lumbering and clearance of native vegetation, mining,{{Cite journal

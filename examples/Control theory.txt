CONTROL THEORY
 Control theory is a field of control engineering and applied mathematics that deals with the
control of dynamical systems in engineered processes and machines.  The objective is to develop a
model or algorithm governing the application of system inputs to drive the system to a desired
state, while minimizing any delay, overshoot, or steady-state error and ensuring a level of control
stability; often with the aim to achieve a degree of optimality.

OPTIMAL CONTROL
Optimal control theory is a branch of mathematical optimization that deals with finding a control
for a dynamical system over a period of time such that an objective function is optimized.  It has
numerous applications in science, engineering and operations research.

CONTROL (OPTIMAL CONTROL THEORY)
In optimal control theory, a control is a variable chosen by the controller or agent to manipulate
state variables, similar to an actual control valve.  Unlike the state variable, it does not have a
predetermined equation of motion.

DUAL CONTROL THEORY
Dual control theory is a branch of control theory that deals with the control of systems whose
characteristics are initially unknown.  It is called dual because in controlling such a system the
controller's objectives are twofold:

ACKERMANN'S FORMULA
 In control theory, Ackermann's formula is a control system design method for solving the pole
allocation problem for invariant-time systems by Jurgen Ackermann.  One of the primary problems in
control system design is the creation of controllers that will change the dynamics of a system by
changing the eigenvalues of the matrix representing the dynamics of the closed-loop system.

GAIN SCHEDULING
 In control theory, gain scheduling is an approach to control of nonlinear systems that uses a
family of linear controllers, each of which provides satisfactory control for a different operating
point of the system.

SELF-ORGANIZED CRITICALITY CONTROL
 In applied physics, the concept of controlling self-organized criticality refers to the control of
processes by which a self-organized system dissipates energy.  The objective of the control is to
reduce the probability of occurrence of and size of energy dissipation bursts, often called
avalanches, of self-organized systems.

SELF-TUNING
 In control theory a self-tuning system is capable of optimizing its own internal running parameters
in order to maximize or minimize the fulfilment of an objective function; typically the maximization
of efficiency or error minimization.

IMPLEMENTATION
 Implementation is the realization of an application, execution of a plan, idea, model, design,
specification, standard, algorithm, policy, or the administration or management of a process or

BOWYER-WATSON ALGORITHM
 In computational geometry, the Bowyer-Watson algorithm is a method for computing the Delaunay
triangulation of a finite set of points in any number of dimensions.  The algorithm can be also used
to obtain a Voronoi diagram of the points, which is the dual graph of the Delaunay triangulation.

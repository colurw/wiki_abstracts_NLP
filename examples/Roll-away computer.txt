ROLL-OFF
Roll-off is the steepness of a transfer function with frequency, particularly in electrical network
analysis, and most especially in connection with filter circuits in the transition between a
passband and a stopband.  It is most typically applied to the insertion loss of the network, but
can, in principle, be applied to any relevant function of frequency, and any technology, not just
electronics.

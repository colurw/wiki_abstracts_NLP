STEP-INDEX PROFILE
 For an optical fiber, a step-index profile is a refractive index profile characterized by a uniform
refractive index within the core and a sharp decrease in refractive index at the core-cladding [so
that the cladding is of a lower refractive index.  The step-index profile corresponds to a power-law
index profile] with the profile parameter approaching infinity.

REFRACTIVE INDEX PROFILE
A refractive index profile is the distribution of refractive indices of materials within an optical
fiber.  Some optical fiber has a step-index profile, in which the core has one uniformly-distributed
index and the cladding has a lower uniformly-distributed index.
[score: 0.870] 

GRADED-INDEX FIBER
A graded-index fiber, or gradient-index fiber, is an optical fiber whose core has a refractive index
that decreases continuously with increasing radial distance from the optical axis of the fiber, as
opposed to a step-index fiber, which has a uniform index of refraction in the core, and a lower
index in the surrounding cladding.

REFRACTIVE INDEX CONTRAST
Refractive index contrast, in an optical waveguide, such as an optical fiber, is a measure of the
relative difference in refractive index of the core and cladding.  The refractive index contrast, D,
is often given by \Delta={n_1^2-n_2^2 \over 2 n_1^2}, where n1 is the maximum refractive index in
the core (or simply the core index for a step-index profile) and n2 is the refractive index of the
cladding.

STEPPED PROFILE
A stepped profile describes the edge of something that has a series of defined steps.  It has
applications in architecture, construction, engineering, and geology.

 uuencoding is a form of binary-to-text encoding that originated in the Unix programs uuencode and
uudecode written by Mary Ann Horton at the University of California, Berkeley in 1980, for encoding
binary data for transmission in email systems.

XXENCODING
xxencode is a binary-to-text encoding similar to uuencode which uses only the alphanumeric
characters, and the plus and minus signs.  It was invented as a means to transfer files in a format
which would survive character set translation, particularly that between ASCII and the EBCDIC
encoding used on IBM mainframes.

BINHEX
BinHex, originally short for "binary-to-hexadecimal", is a binary-to-text encoding system that was
used on the classic Mac OS for sending binary files through e-mail.  Originally a hexadecimal
encoding, subsequent versions of BinHex are more similar to uuencode, but combined both "forks" of
the Mac file system together along with extended file information.

EBCDIC
Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC; ) is an eight-bit character encoding used
mainly on IBM mainframe and IBM midrange computer operating systems.  It descended from the code
used with punched cards and the corresponding six-bit binary-coded decimal code used with most of
IBM's computer peripherals of the late 1950s and early 1960s.

TRUNCATED BINARY ENCODING
Truncated binary encoding is an entropy encoding typically used for uniform probability
distributions with a finite alphabet.  It is parameterized by an alphabet with total size of number
n.

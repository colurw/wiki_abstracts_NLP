HIGH PRESSURE
 In science and engineering the study of high pressure examines its effects on materials and the
design and construction of devices, such as a diamond anvil cell, which can create high pressure.
By high pressure is usually meant pressures of thousands (kilobars) or millions (megabars) of times
atmospheric pressure (about 1 bar or 100,000 Pa).

HIGH-PRESSURE CHEMISTRY
High-pressure chemistry is concerned with those chemical processes that are carried out under high
pressure - pressures in the thousands of bars (100 kPa) or higher.  High-pressure processes are
generally faster and have a higher conversion efficiency than processes at ambient pressure.

BARS APPARATUS
BARS (or "split sphere", transliteration from  abbreviation of , (bespressovaya apparatura vysokogo
davleniya <<razreznaya sfera>>), "press-free high-pressure setup <<split sphere>>") a high-pressure
high-temperature apparatus usually used for growing or processing minerals, especially diamond and
boron nitride.  Typical pressures and temperatures achievable with BARS are  and .

RUBY PRESSURE SCALE
The ruby fluorescence pressure scale is an optical method to measure pressure within a sample
chamber of a diamond anvil cell apparatus.  Since it is an optical method, which fully make use of
the transparency of diamond anvils and only requires an access to a small scale laser generator, it
has become the most prevalent pressure gauge method in high pressure sciences.

PRESSURE EXPERIMENT
Pressure experiments are experiments performed at pressures lower or higher than atmospheric
pressure, called low-pressure experiments and high-pressure experiments, respectively.  Pressure
experiment are necessary because substances behave differently at different pressures.

ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE
 Atmospheric pressure, also known as air pressure or barometric pressure (after the barometer), is
the pressure within the atmosphere of Earth.  The standard atmosphere (symbol: atm) is a unit of
pressure defined as , which is equivalent to 1,013.

HIGH PRESSURE JET
 A high pressure jet is a stream of pressurized fluid that is released from an environment at a
significantly higher pressure than ambient pressure from a nozzle or orifice, due to operational or
accidental release.  In the field of safety engineering, the release of toxic and flammable gases
has been the subject of many R&D studies because of the major risk that they pose to the health and
safety of workers, equipment and environment.

SOUND PRESSURE
 Sound pressure or acoustic pressure is the local pressure deviation from the ambient (average or
equilibrium) atmospheric pressure, caused by a sound wave.  In air, sound pressure can be measured
using a microphone, and in water with a hydrophone.

BRIDGMAN AWARD
 The Bridgman Award is a prize given every two years by the International Association for the
Advancement of High Pressure Science and Technology (AIRAPT) for research in the physics, chemistry,
or technology of high pressure science.  The award is named in honor of Percy Williams Bridgman,
Nobel Prize winner and famous pioneer of the physics of high pressure.

AMORPHOUS CARBONIA
 Amorphous carbonia, also called a-carbonia or a-CO2, is an exotic amorphous solid form of carbon
dioxide that is analogous to amorphous silica glass.  It was first made in the laboratory in 2006 by
subjecting dry ice to high pressures (40-48 gigapascal, or 400,000 to 480,000 atmospheres), in a
diamond anvil cell.

EQUIVALENT EFFECTIVE STRATOSPHERIC CHLORINE
 Equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine (EESC) provides an estimate of the total effective
amount of halogens (chlorine and bromine) in the stratosphere.  It is calculated from  emission of
chlorofluorocarbon and related halogenated compounds into the troposphere (lower atmosphere) and
their efficiency in contributing to stratospheric ozone depletion (ozone depletion potential, ODP),
and by making assumptions on transport times into the upper atmosphere (stratosphere).

WHITE-BOX TESTING
 White-box testing (also known as clear box testing, glass box testing, transparent box testing, and
structural testing) is a method of software testing that tests internal structures or workings of an
application, as opposed to its functionality (i.e.

GRAY-BOX TESTING
Gray-box testing (International English spelling: grey-box testing) is a combination of white-box
testing and black-box testing.  The aim of this testing is to search for the defects, if any, due to
improper structure or improper usage of applications.
[score: 0.737] 

BLACK-BOX TESTING
Black-box testing is a method of software testing that examines the functionality of an application
without peering into its internal structures or workings.  This method of test can be applied
virtually to every level of software testing: unit, integration, system and acceptance.

WHITE TEST
In statistics, the White test is a statistical test that establishes whether the variance of the
errors in a regression model is constant: that is for  homoskedasticity.

IN-CIRCUIT TESTING
In-circuit testing (ICT) is an example of white box testing where an electrical probe tests a
populated printed circuit board (PCB), checking for shorts, opens, resistance, capacitance, and
other basic quantities which will show whether the assembly was correctly fabricated.  It may be
performed with a "bed of nails" test fixture and specialist test equipment, or with a fixtureless
in-circuit test setup.

MODEL-BASED TESTING
 Model-based testing is an application of model-based design for designing and optionally also
executing artifacts to perform software testing or system testing.  Models can be used to represent
the desired behavior of a system under test (SUT), or to represent testing strategies and a test
environment.

KEYWORD-DRIVEN TESTING
 Keyword-driven testing, also known as action word based testing (not to be confused with action
driven testing), is a software testing methodology suitable for both manual and automated testing.
This method separates the documentation of test casesincluding both the data and functionality to
usefrom the prescription of the way the test cases are executed.

ENGINEERING PHYSICS
 Engineering physics, or engineering science, refers to the study of the combined disciplines of
physics, mathematics, chemistry, biology, and engineering, particularly computer, nuclear,
electrical, electronic, aerospace, materials or mechanical engineering.  By focusing on the
scientific method as a rigorous basis, it seeks ways to apply, design, and develop new solutions in
engineering.

ENGINEERING
Engineering is the practice of using natural science, mathematics, and the engineering design
process to solve problems, increase efficiency and productivity, and improve systems.  Modern
engineering comprises many subfields which include designing and creating infrastructure, machinery,
vehicles, electronics, materials, and energy.

ENGINEER
Engineers, as practitioners of engineering, are professionals who invent, design, analyze, build and
test machines, complex systems, structures, gadgets and materials to fulfill functional objectives
and requirements while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety and
cost.  "Science is knowledge based on our observed facts and tested truths arranged in an orderly
system that can be validated and communicated to other people.

ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS
Engineering mathematics is a branch of applied mathematics concerning mathematical methods and
techniques that are typically used in engineering and industry.  Along with fields like engineering
physics and engineering geology, both of which may belong in the wider category engineering science,
engineering mathematics is an interdisciplinary subject motivated by engineers' needs both for
practical, theoretical and other considerations outside their specialization, and to deal with
constraints to be effective in their work.

ENGINEERING STUDIES
Engineering studies is an interdisciplinary branch of social sciences and humanities devoted to the
study of engineers and their activities, often considered a part of science and technology studies
(STS), and intersecting with and drawing from engineering education research.  Studying engineers
refers among other to the history and the sociology of their profession, its institutionalization
and organization, the social composition and structure of the population of engineers, their
training, their trajectory, etc.

BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING
 Biomechanical engineering, also considered a subfield of mechanical engineering and biomedical
engineering, combines principles of physics (with a focus on mechanics), biology, and engineering.
Topics of interest in this field include (experimental and theoretical) biomechanics, computational
mechanics, continuum mechanics, bioinstrumentation, design of implants and prostheses, etc.

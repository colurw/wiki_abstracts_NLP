ASTROCYTE
 Astrocytes (from Ancient Greek , "star" + , , "cavity", "cell"), also known collectively as
astroglia, are characteristic star-shaped glial cells in the brain and spinal cord.  They perform
many functions, including biochemical control of endothelial cells that form the blood-brain
barrier, provision of nutrients to the nervous tissue, maintenance of extracellular ion balance,
regulation of cerebral blood flow, and a role in the repair and scarring process of the brain and
spinal cord following infection and traumatic injuries.

ASTROGLIOSIS
Astrogliosis (also known as astrocytosis or referred to as reactive astrogliosis) is an abnormal
increase in the number of astrocytes due to the destruction of nearby neurons from central nervous
system (CNS) trauma, infection, ischemia, stroke, autoimmune responses or neurodegenerative disease.
In healthy neural tissue, astrocytes play critical roles in energy provision, regulation of blood
flow, homeostasis of extracellular fluid, homeostasis of ions and transmitters, regulation of
synapse function and synaptic remodeling.

GLIA
Glia, also called glial cells (gliocytes) or neuroglia, are non-neuronal cells in the central
nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the peripheral nervous system that do not produce
electrical impulses.  The neuroglia make up more than one half the volume of neural tissue in our
body.

OLIGODENDROCYTE
Oligodendrocytes (), also known as oligodendroglia, are a type of neuroglia whose main functions are
to provide support and insulation to axons within the central nervous system (CNS) of jawed
vertebrates.  Their function is similar to that of Schwann cells, which perform the same task in the
peripheral nervous system (PNS).

SCHWANN CELL
Schwann cells or neurolemmocytes (named after German physiologist Theodor Schwann) are the principal
glia of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Glial cells function to support neurons and in the PNS,
also include satellite cells, olfactory ensheathing cells, enteric glia and glia that reside at
sensory nerve endings, such as the Pacinian corpuscle.

GLIA LIMITANS
 The glia limitans, or the glial limiting membrane, is a thin barrier of astrocyte foot processes
associated with the parenchymal basal lamina surrounding the brain and spinal cord.  It is the
outermost layer of neural tissue, and among its responsibilities is the prevention of the over-
migration of neurons and neuroglia, the supporting cells of the nervous system, into the meninges.

SUPERFICIAL SIDEROSIS
 Superficial hemosiderosis of the central nervous system is a disease of the brain resulting from
chronic iron deposition in neuronal tissues associated with cerebrospinal fluid.  This occurs via
the deposition of hemosiderin in neuronal tissue, and is associated with neuronal loss, gliosis, and
demyelination of neuronal cells.

ARACHNOIDITIS
 Arachnoiditis is an inflammatory condition of the arachnoid mater or 'arachnoid', one of the
membranes known as meninges that surround and protect the nerves of the central nervous system,
including the brain and spinal cord.  The arachnoid can become inflamed because of adverse reactions
to chemicals, infection from bacteria or viruses, as the result of direct injury to the spine,
chronic compression of spinal nerves, complications from spinal surgery or other invasive spinal
procedures, or the accidental intrathecal injection of steroids intended for the epidural space.

TISSUE FACTOR
 Tissue factor, also called platelet tissue factor, factor III, or CD142, is a protein encoded by
the F3 gene, present in subendothelial tissue and leukocytes.  Its role in the clotting process is
the initiation of thrombin formation from the zymogen prothrombin.

ENTEROCHROMAFFIN CELL
 Enterochromaffin (EC) cells (also known as Kulchitsky cells) are a type of enteroendocrine cell,
and neuroendocrine cell.  They reside alongside the epithelium lining the lumen of the digestive
tract and play a crucial role in gastrointestinal regulation, particularly intestinal motility and
secretion.

PANCREATIC NEUROENDOCRINE TUMOR
 Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PanNETs, PETs, or PNETs), often referred to as "islet cell
tumours", or "pancreatic endocrine tumours" are neuroendocrine neoplasms that arise from cells of
the endocrine (hormonal) and nervous system within the pancreas.

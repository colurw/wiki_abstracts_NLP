FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES
 For all practical purposes, sometimes abbreviated FAPP, is a slogan used in physics to express a
[attitude.  A physical theory might be ambiguous in some ways -- for example, being founded on
untested assumptions or making unclear predictions about what might happen in certain situations --
and yet still be successful in practice.

LOS-VAUGHT TEST
 In model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, the Los-Vaught test is a criterion for a theory to
be complete, unable to be augmented without becoming inconsistent.  For theories in classical logic,
this means that for every sentence, the theory contains either the sentence or its negation but not
both.

METATHEOREM
 In logic, a metatheorem is a statement about a formal system proven in a metalanguage.  Unlike
theorems proved within a given formal system, a metatheorem is proved within a metatheory, and may
reference concepts that are present in the metatheory but not the object theory.

GENERIC FILTER
 In the mathematical field of set theory, a generic filter is a kind of object used in the theory of
forcing, a technique used for many purposes, but especially to establish the independence of certain
propositions from certain formal theories, such as ZFC. For example, Paul Cohen used forcing to
establish that ZFC, if consistent, cannot prove the continuum hypothesis, which states that there
are exactly aleph-one real numbers.

BOOLEAN-VALUED MODEL
 In mathematical logic, a Boolean-valued model is a generalization of the ordinary Tarskian notion
of structure from model theory.  In a Boolean-valued model, the truth values of propositions are not
limited to "true" and "false", but instead take values in some fixed complete Boolean algebra.

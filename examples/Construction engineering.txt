CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING
 Construction engineering, also known as construction operations, is a professional subdiscipline of
civil engineering that deals with the designing, planning, construction, and operations management
of infrastructure such as roadways, tunnels, bridges, airports, railroads, facilities, buildings,
dams, utilities and other projects.  Construction engineers learn some of the design aspects similar
to civil engineers as well as project management aspects.

STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING
Structural engineering is a sub-discipline of civil engineering in which structural engineers are
trained to design the 'bones and muscles' that create the form and shape of human-made structures.
Structural engineers also must understand and calculate the stability, strength, rigidity and
earthquake-susceptibility of built structures for buildingsFAO online publication  and nonbuilding
structures.

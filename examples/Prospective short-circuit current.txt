PROSPECTIVE SHORT-CIRCUIT CURRENT
 The prospective short-circuit current (PSCC), available fault current, or short-circuit making
current is the highest electric current which can exist in a particular electrical system under
short-circuit conditions.  It is determined by the voltage and impedance of the supply system.

SHORT CIRCUIT
A short circuit (sometimes abbreviated to short or s/c) is an electrical circuit that allows a
current to travel along an unintended path with no or very low electrical impedance.  This results
in an excessive current flowing through the circuit.

CONDITIONAL SHORT-CIRCUIT CURRENT
Conditional short-circuit current is the value of the alternating current component of a prospective
current, which a switch without integral short-circuit protection, but protected by a suitable short
circuit protective device (SCPD) in series, can withstand for the operating time of the current
under specified test conditions.  It may be understood to be the RMS value of the maximum
permissible current over a specified time interval (t0,t1) and operating conditions.

ELECTRICAL FAULT
In an electric power system, a fault  or fault current is any abnormal electric current.  For
example, a short circuit is a fault in which a live wire touches a neutral or ground wire.

PASSIVE SIGN CONVENTION
In electrical engineering, the passive sign convention (PSC) is a sign convention or arbitrary
standard rule adopted universally by the electrical engineering community for defining the sign of
electric power in an electric circuit.   The convention defines electric power flowing out of the
circuit into an electrical component as positive, and power flowing into the circuit out of a
component as negative.

POWER FACTOR
 In electrical engineering, the power factor of an AC power system is defined as the ratio of the
real power absorbed by the load to the apparent power flowing in the circuit.  Real power is the
average of the instantaneous product of voltage and current and represents the capacity of the
electricity for performing work.

HOLDING CURRENT (ELECTRONICS)
 The holding current (hypostatic) for electrical, electromagnetic, and electronic devices is the
minimum current which must pass through a circuit in order for it to remain in the 'ON' state.  The
term can be applied to a single switch or to an entire device.

LEADING AND LAGGING CURRENT
 Leading and lagging current are phenomena that occur as a result of alternating current.  In a
circuit with alternating current, the value of voltage and current vary sinusoidally.

VOLTAGE SYMMETRIZATION SYSTEM
 Voltage Symmetrization System (VSS) was developed especially for electric power networks with great
phase voltage unbalance.  It is a three-phase system which enables earth-fault current and charging
current elimination.

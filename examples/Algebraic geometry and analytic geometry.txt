ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY AND ANALYTIC GEOMETRY
 In mathematics, algebraic geometry and analytic geometry are two closely related subjects.  While
algebraic geometry studies algebraic varieties, analytic geometry deals with complex manifolds and
the more general analytic spaces defined locally by the vanishing of analytic functions of several
complex variables.

COMPLEX GEOMETRY
In mathematics, complex geometry is the study of geometric structures and constructions arising out
of, or described by, the complex numbers.  In particular, complex geometry is concerned with the
study of spaces such as complex manifolds and complex algebraic varieties, functions of several
complex variables, and holomorphic constructions such as holomorphic vector bundles and coherent
sheaves.

ANALYTIC GEOMETRY
In mathematics, analytic geometry, also known as coordinate geometry or Cartesian geometry, is the
study of geometry using a coordinate system.  This contrasts with synthetic geometry.

COMPLEX ANALYTIC VARIETY
In mathematics, and in particular differential geometry and complex geometry, a complex analytic
variety Complex analytic variety (or just variety) is sometimes required to be irreducible

ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY
Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics which classically studies zeros of multivariate
polynomials.  Modern algebraic geometry is based on the use of abstract algebraic techniques, mainly
from commutative algebra, for solving geometrical problems about these sets of zeros.

DOLBEAULT COHOMOLOGY
 In mathematics, in particular in algebraic geometry and differential geometry, Dolbeault cohomology
(named after Pierre Dolbeault) is an analog of de Rham cohomology for complex manifolds.  Let M be a
complex manifold.

RIEMANN-ROCH THEOREM
 The Riemann-Roch theorem is an important theorem in mathematics, specifically in complex analysis
and algebraic geometry, for the computation of the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions
with prescribed zeros and allowed poles.  It relates the complex analysis of a connected compact
Riemann surface with the surface's purely topological genus g, in a way that can be carried over
into purely algebraic settings.
